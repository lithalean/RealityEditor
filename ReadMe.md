# RealityEditor Project Roadmap

> **Goal**: Build a Godot-inspired 3D scene editor optimized for Apple's ecosystem using RealityKit and Darwin ARM64.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

**RealityEditor** = RealityViewport + RealityInspector + Future Modules

Starting small with the core scene editing experience, then gradually adding Godot's feature set as modular Apple-native components.

  ├── RealityViewport/ (3D viewport)
  ├── RealityInspector/ (UI panels)
  └── Shared/ (Extensions, utilities)
  ```
- [x] Dependencies and build configuration

#### ✅ Core Node System **COMPLETED**
- [x] `SceneNode` protocol with transform properties
- [x] `BaseSceneNode` implementation

- [x] `ModelNode` with USDZ loading capability
- [x] Transform system (position, rotation, scale)

#### ✅ Basic Viewport **COMPLETED**
- [x] `ViewportView` with RealityView integration
- [x] 3D grid system with colored axes (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue)
- [x] `CameraController` with orbit controls
- [x] Scene rendering (lights, models, grid)
- [x] Basic gesture handling (orbit, zoom)

#### ✅ Basic Inspector **COMPLETED**
- [x] `OutlinerView` - Blender-style scene hierarchy
- [x] `PropertiesView` - Node-specific property panels
- [x] Node selection system with visual feedback
- [x] Transform property display
- [x] Camera/Light/Model specific properties
- [x] Active camera indication

#### ✅ Additional Features Implemented
- [x] Default scene setup (Camera + Light, Blender positions)
- [x] USDZ file import with file picker
- [x] Auto-scaling imported models
- [x] Node type icons and visual hierarchy
- [x] Clean modular architecture
- [x] Comprehensive property inspection

### ✅ Phase 1 Deliverables **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Working 3D viewport** with grid and orbit controls
- [x] **Scene hierarchy** with 3 node types (Camera, Light, Model)
- [x] **Inspector panels** showing node properties
- [x] **USDZ import** functionality
- [x] **Basic scene management** (add, remove, select nodes)
- [x] **Default scene** that matches Blender's setup

### 📊 Phase 1 Success Metrics - **ALL MET**
- ✅ Can load app and see 3D viewport with grid
- ✅ Can import USDZ models and see them rendered
- ✅ Can select nodes in outliner and see properties

## 🛠️ Development Principles

### Technical Standards
- **Swift-first**: Native Swift throughout, no bridges
- **RealityKit-native**: Leverage Apple's 3D framework fully
- **Modular design**: Each feature as a separate, testable module
- **Performance-focused**: Optimized for Apple Silicon
- **SwiftUI-based**: Modern Apple UI patterns

### Quality Metrics
- **Code coverage**: >80% test coverage for core modules
- **Performance**: 60fps viewport at all times
- **Memory**: Efficient memory usage for large scenes
- **Stability**: No crashes during normal workflow
