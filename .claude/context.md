## üß† Core Architecture Decisions Made
```
DECISION_LOG:
[DATE] - Chose @Observable over ObservableObject for iOS 17+ performance
[DATE] - Document-based architecture for native file handling  
[DATE] - JSON storage for git-friendly version control
[DATE] - Mac Catalyst over separate macOS app for code reuse
[DATE] - Canvas API for custom drawing performance
[DATE] - Material Design System following WWDC25 principles
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Stack State
```swift
// Current Architecture Pattern
@Observable class [MAIN_MODEL] {
	// State management approach
}

// Document Pattern
struct [PROJECT]Document: ReferenceFileDocument {
	// File handling pattern
}

// View Architecture
ContentView (Adaptive Container)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sidebar/TabBar (Platform Adaptive)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [MAIN_VIEW] (Primary Interface)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [SECONDARY_VIEW] (Support Interface)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DocumentBrowser (File Management)
```

## üé® Design System Implemented

## üìö Key Patterns & Conventions Established
```swift
// File Organization Pattern
[PROJECT_NAME]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/           // @Observable classes, data structures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/            // SwiftUI views, organized by feature
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/         // Business logic, API layers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extensions/       // Swift extensions, utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Resources/        // Assets, JSON files, etc.

// Naming Conventions
- Views: [Feature]View.swift
- Models: [Entity].swift  
- Services: [Feature]Service.swift
- Extensions: [Type]+[Feature].swift

// State Management Pattern
@StateObject for view-owned state
@Environment for dependency injection
@Observable for shared app state
```

- Darwin ARM64 optimization priority
- Mac Catalyst limitations awareness
- SwiftUI-only, no UIKit mixing
- Document-based architecture requirements

USER_EXPERIENCE_PRIORITIES:
1. Fast, responsive interaction
2. Intuitive cross-platform consistency  
3. Professional, clean aesthetic
4. Reliable data persistence
5. Seamless platform-specific behaviors
